When the author uploads the article he (or she) has to first accept a contract of terms and conditions with JARM which states that he (or she) must not divulge their contents to any third party in an unfinished form. Once the author has uploaded his article and has been approved by the editor then the author becomes a reviewer. He has access to that part of the website which contains all the unpublished articles that are awaiting peer-review. This is a secure system, preventing the reviewer from casually reading just any or all of these articles. A reviewer may browse pending articles but initially may only read their abstracts, before deciding whether to review the article, by checking a box next to that article. Three articles must be chosen explicitly and peer-reviewed.
<br><br>
The system will keep track of how many articles the reviewer has selected so far for review, and will display these titles to the reviewer, along with their review status (downloaded or review submitted).
<br><br>
Once the reviewer has selected one to three articles for review, he (or she) may download the draft PDF versions of those articles, after which he (or she) is committed to review those articles and may not choose to go back, in favour of some other article. 
Later, they must submit their review(s) of article(s) using a particular review form. 
The review form contains: an overall judgement (using the &#39;champion/detractor&#39; pattern &#45; see below); the relevant expertise level of the reviewer (on 3-point scale: expert, knowledgeable, outsider); a summary of the content and novel contribution of the article (as proof that the reviewer has understood it and believes in its good points); and a structured criticism of any bad points (issues that the authors must explicitly address in their revision). 
Successful review submission should be acknowledged by a web page and an email sent to the reviewer, detailing the content of the review. A reviewer should be able to track reviews submitted, and submit a revised review after which the review can no longer be changed, and it is forwarded by the system to the author(s). 
<br><br>
All reviews are anonymous, so the authors don&#39;t know the identity of the reviewers.
If accepting, the reviewer may revise the overall judgement on the paper (according to the champion/detractor model). If rejecting, they must explain why the revision is not adequate, and may explicitly highlight further bad points to address in a form. 
A reviewer will not be asked to review the same article more than twice. Then the editor can decide and make the decision to publish which articles.
